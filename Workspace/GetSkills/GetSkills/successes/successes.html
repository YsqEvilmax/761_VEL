Lonnie enjoys transforming people and organizations through coaching, conflict resolution, performance management, or simply imparting knowledge. Lonnie began working with Scrum in 2006 and her Scrum training has taken her across the country and to India and Canada where she has shared her knowledge and experience with Scrum. Helping Scrum teams learn and grow together until they reach a high performing stage is Lonnie's passion. Her candid and patient coaching style helps people understand how to make the necessary behavioral changes to make Scrum work for their teams. She also enjoys partnering with leaders to help them understand how the changes will impact them and their organization. Lonnie has seen Scrum work very well and she has seen it fail. She shares these experiences in her classroom so that students can benefit from her own personal experience. Lonnie has been an IT leader, a business analyst, a corporate trainer, a Toastmaster officer, a public speaker in her community, and a volunteer at local high schools training kids on team development. In each of these cases Lonnie brings high energy to her classes, motivates the learners, and uses humor and stories to keep people engaged.
